# Diamond Diagram (Complete Graph)

A Diamond Diagram, or a complete graph $K_n$, is a geometric representation where $n$ vertices are arranged evenly on the circumference of a circle.

In a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. This visualization allows you to explore the patterns formed by these connections as the number of vertices increases.

## Features

- **Vertices (n)**: Adjust the number of vertices on the circle.
- **Radius (r)**: Change the size of the circle.
- **Color Randomization**: Toggle to assign a random color to each line connecting the vertices.
